# Scala Presentation
Presentation for teaching Scala to my Programming Languages class after attempting to teach it to myself as our final project. Most of the source code comes from https://docs.scala-lang.org/tour/basics.html, while some of it comes from StackOverflow, TutorialsPoint, alvinalexander.com, and Baeldung.
The midpoint formula code and primes code calculation come from previous class notes and StackOverflow.
